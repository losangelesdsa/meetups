This is the Git repository for [Los Angeles Data Structures and Algorithms][ladsa]. It contains source code from our meetups, usually written in Python.

Most programs should be runnable via `python <file>`, in your command-line. If further dependencies or libraries are needed, they should be specified in a `README.md` in the appropriate directory.
